# MyMacro
This is an application designed to help students who are on a university/college meal plan ensure they eat enough of each macronutrient (protein, carbs, fats) without overeating in calories by generating a meal plan based on that day's posted menu

The first iteration of this application will be web-based and only work for Queens University's Leonard dining hall

That is very cool - dad
